A Bare Bones Express Framework.

## Why Facile

Frameworks are great and they're needed when working with node based
server implementations. However many frameworks try to do too much
including those we've built in the past. Particularly in the workflow
build process. Simply put there are too many variables to account for.

Hence Facile, pronounced "fas…ôl", ignores complexity and gets out of
the way of the developer.

Facile exposes methods that allow you to configure and start your api
server and leaves the rest up to you.
